== Preface

=== Objectives of Document
This document presents the Common Criteria (CC) collaborative Protection Profile (cPP) to express the security functional requirements (SFRs) and security assurance requirements (SARs) for _some technology type_. The Evaluation activities that specify the actions the evaluator performs to determine if a product satisfies the SFRs captured within this cPP, are described in <<SD>>.

=== Scope of Document
The scope of the cPP within the development and evaluation process is described in the Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation. In particular, a cPP defines the IT security requirements of a generic type of TOE and specifies the functional security measures to be offered by that TOE to meet stated requirements [<<CC1>>, Section B.14].

=== Intended Readership
The target audiences of this cPP are developers, CC consumers, system integrators, evaluators and schemes. 

Although the cPP and SD may contain minor editorial errors, the cPP is recognized as living document and the iTC is dedicated to ongoing updates and revisions. Please report any issues to the _this_ iTC.

=== TOE Overview
NOTE: This may be short, but is likely to be 1-2 pages

=== TOE Design
NOTE: This may not be necessary depending on the technology type. It may already be clear what the design is, or it is covered in the Overview. For example in the Network cPP there is an entire section dedicated to use case/design selections to deal with distributed TOEs.

=== TOE Use Case
If you are defining use cases (such as specific use scenarios that may have unique requirement selections), put that here.

==== USE CASE 1: first use case


==== USE CASE 2: second use case



== CC Conformance Claims
As defined by the references <<CC1>>, <<CC2>> and <<CC3>>, this cPP:

* conforms to the requirements of Common Criteria v3.1, Revision 5,
* is Part 2 extended,
* does not claim conformance to any other security functional requirement packages.

NOTE: The following paragraph may not be applicable for app cPPs and should be added or edited as appropriate.

_In order to be conformant to this cPP, a ST shall demonstrate Exact Conformance. Exact Conformance, as a subset of Strict Conformance as defined by the CC, is defined as the ST containing all of the SFRs in <<Security Functional Requirements>> (these are the mandatory SFRs) of this cPP, and potentially SFRs from <<Consistency Rationale>> (these are selection-based SFRs) and <<Selection-Based Requirements>> (these are optional SFRs) of this cPP. While iteration is allowed, no additional requirements (from the CC parts 2 or 3, or definitions of extended components not already included in this cPP) are allowed to be included in the ST. Further, no SFRs in <<Security Functional Requirements>> of this cPP are allowed to be omitted._

== Security Problem Definition

The security problem is described in terms of the threats that the TOE is expected to address, assumptions about its operational environment, and any organizational security policies that the TOE is expected to enforce.

== Security Assurance Requirements
The <<Security Objectives>> for the TOE were constructed to address <<threats>> identified in the <<Security Problem Definition>>. The <<Security Functional Requirements>> are a formal instantiation of the <<Security Objectives>>. This cPP identifies the Security Assurance Requirements to frame the extent to which the evaluator assesses the documentation applicable for the evaluation and performs independent testing. 

This section lists the set of SARs from CC part 3 that are required in evaluations against this cPP. Individual Evaluation Activities to be performed are specified in <<SD>>. 

The general model for evaluation of TOEs against STs written to conform to this cPP is as follows: 

After the ST has been approved for evaluation, the ITSEF will obtain the TOE, supporting environmental IT (if required), and the administrative/user guides for the TOE. The ITSEF is expected to perform actions mandated by the Common Evaluation Methodology (CEM) for the ASE and ALC SARs. The ITSEF also performs the Evaluation Activities contained within the SD, which are intended to be an interpretation of the other CEM assurance requirements as they apply to the specific technology instantiated in the TOE. The Evaluation Activities that are captured in the SD also provide clarification as to what the developer needs to provide to demonstrate the TOE is compliant with the cPP.

=== ASE: Security Target
The ST is evaluated as per ASE activities defined in the <<CEM>>. In addition, there may be Evaluation Activities specified within the <<SD>> that call for necessary descriptions to be included in the TSS that are specific to the TOE technology type.

NOTE: As an option, the cPP may express a need for a more detailed description of how a TOE satisfies one or more SFRs. The level of detail required by the SD may include proprietary information, or simply information that should not be made public (i.e., provides attackers insight into the operation of the TOE that may increase the likelihood of a successful attack against the product). This information could be submitted as an appendix to the ST or as a separate document. The required information may take the form of a refinement as shown below, and the associated Evaluation Activity would be specified in the SD.

=== ADV: Development
The design information about the TOE is contained in the guidance documentation available to the end user as well as the TSS portion of the ST, and any additional information required by this cPP that is not to be made public (e.g., Entropy Report).

==== Basic Functional Specification (ADV_FSP.1)
The functional specification describes the TOE Security Functions Interfaces (TSFIs). It is not necessary to have a formal or complete specification of these interfaces. Additionally, because TOEs conforming to this cPP will necessarily have interfaces to the Operational Environment that are not directly invokable by TOE users, there is little point specifying that such interfaces be described in and of themselves since only indirect testing of such interfaces may be possible. For this cPP, the Evaluation Activities for this family focus on understanding the interfaces presented in the TSS in response to the functional requirements and the interfaces presented in the AGD documentation. No additional “functional specification” documentation is necessary to satisfy the Evaluation Activities specified in <<SD>>.

The Evaluation Activities in <<SD>> are associated with the applicable SFRs; since these are directly associated with the SFRs, the tracing in element ADV_FSP.1.2D is implicitly already done and no additional documentation is necessary.

=== AGD: Guidance Documentation
The guidance documents will be provided with the ST. Guidance must include a description of how the IT personnel verifies that the Operational Environment can fulfill its role for the security functionality. The documentation should be in an informal style and readable by the IT personnel.

Guidance must be provided for every operational environment that the product supports as claimed in the ST. This guidance includes:

* instructions to successfully install the TSF in that environment; and
* instructions to manage the security of the TSF as a product and as a component of the larger operational environment; and
* instructions to provide a protected administrative capability.

Guidance pertaining to particular security functionality must also be provided; requirements on such guidance are contained in the Evaluation Activities specified in the <<SD>>.

==== Operational User Guidance (AGD_OPE.1)
The operational user guidance does not have to be contained in a single document. Guidance to users, administrators and application developers can be spread among documents or web pages.

The developer should review the Evaluation Activities contained in the <<SD>> to ascertain the specifics of the guidance that the evaluator will be checking for. This will provide the necessary information for the preparation of acceptable guidance. 

==== Preparative Procedures (AGD_PRE.1)
As with the operational guidance, the developer should look to the Evaluation Activities to determine the required content with respect to preparative procedures.

=== Class ALC: Life-cycle Support
At the assurance level provided for TOEs conformant to this cPP, life-cycle support is limited to end-user-visible aspects of the life-cycle, rather than an examination of the TOE vendor’s development and configuration management process. This is not meant to diminish the critical role that a developer’s practices play in contributing to the overall trustworthiness of a product; rather, it is a reflection on the information to be made available for evaluation at this assurance level.

==== Labelling of the TOE (ALC_CMC.1)
This component is targeted at identifying the TOE such that it can be distinguished from other products or versions from the same vendor and can be easily specified when being procured by an end user.

==== TOE CM Coverage (ALC_CMS.1)
Given the scope of the TOE and its associated evaluation evidence requirements, the evaluator performs the CEM work units associated with ALC_CMC.1. 

=== Class ATE: Tests
Testing is specified for functional aspects of the system as well as aspects that take advantage of design or implementation weaknesses. The former is done through the ATE_IND family, while the latter is through the AVA_VAN family. For this cPP, testing is based on advertised functionality and interfaces with dependency on the availability of design information. One of the primary outputs of the evaluation process is the test report as specified in the following requirements.

==== Independent Testing – Conformance (ATE_IND.1)
Testing is performed to confirm the functionality described in the TSS as well as the operational guidance (includes “evaluated configuration” instructions). The focus of the testing is to confirm that the requirements specified in Section 5 are being met. The Evaluation Activities in the SD identify the specific testing activities necessary to verify compliance with the SFRs. The evaluator produces a test report documenting the plan for and results of testing, as well as coverage arguments focused on the platform/TOE combinations that are claiming conformance to this cPP.

=== Class AVA: Vulnerability Assessment

NOTE: AVA is a diffucult subject. This is taken from the NDcPP v2.1 as an example, but will need to be determined by the iTC.

For the first generation of this cPP, the iTC is expected to survey open sources to discover what vulnerabilities have been discovered in these types of products and provide that content into the AVA_VAN discussion. In most cases, these vulnerabilities will require sophistication beyond that of a basic attacker. This information will be used in the development of future protection profiles.

==== Vulnerability Survey (AVA_VAN.1)
<<SD>> provides a guide to the evaluator in performing a vulnerability analysis.





== Optional Requirements

ST authors are free to choose none, some or all SFRs defined in this chapter. Just the fact that a product supports a certain functionality does not mandate to add any SFR defined in this chapter.

NOTE: This section should contain any SFRs considered "optional" by the iTC. If there are none, then that should be stated (that there are no optional requirements in the cPP).


== Selection-Based Requirements

As indicated in the introduction to this cPP, the baseline requirements (those that shall be performed by the TOE) are contained in <<Security Functional Requirements>>. Additionally, there are two other types of requirements specified in <<Consistency Rationale>> and <<Selection-Based Requirements>>.

The first type (in this chapter) comprises requirements based on selections in other SFRs from the cPP: if certain selections are made, then additional requirements in this chapter will need to be included in the body of the ST.

The second type (in this chapter) comprises requirements that can be included in the ST, but are not mandatory for a TOE to claim conformance to this cPP.


== Extended Component Definitions
This appendix contains the definitions for the extended requirements that are used in the cPP, including those used in <<Consistency Rationale>> and <<Selection-Based Requirements>> . 

(Note: formatting conventions for selections and assignments in this chapter are those in <<CC2>>.)

NOTE: If Extended SFRs are created they must be defined here. An example is copied here from the Biometrics Security PP-Module (because it is short).

== Entropy Documentation and Assessment

NOTE: This section may not always be applicable when talking about PP-Modules (which may rely on entropy from a Base-PP). This particular section is copied from the NDcPP.

This appendix describes the required supplementary information for each entropy source used by the TOE.

The documentation of the entropy source(s) should be detailed enough that, after reading, the evaluator will thoroughly understand the entropy source and why it can be relied upon to provide sufficient entropy. This documentation should include multiple detailed sections: design description, entropy justification, operating conditions, and health testing. This documentation is not required to be part of the TSS.

=== Design Description
Documentation shall include the design of each entropy source as a whole, including the interaction of all entropy source components. Any information that can be shared regarding the design should also be included for any third-party entropy sources that are included in the product.

The documentation will describe the operation of the entropy source to include how entropy is produced, and how unprocessed (raw) data can be obtained from within the entropy source for testing purposes. The documentation should walk through the entropy source design indicating
where the entropy comes from, where the entropy output is passed next, any post-processing of the raw outputs (hash, XOR, etc.), if/where it is stored, and finally, how it is output from the entropy source. Any conditions placed on the process (e.g., blocking) should also be described
in the entropy source design. Diagrams and examples are encouraged.

This design must also include a description of the content of the security boundary of the entropy source and a description of how the security boundary ensures that an adversary outside the boundary cannot affect the entropy rate.

If implemented, the design description shall include a description of how third-party applications can add entropy to the RBG. A description of any RBG state saving between power-off and power-on shall be included.

=== Entropy Justification
There should be a technical argument for where the unpredictability in the source comes from and why there is confidence in the entropy source delivering sufficient entropy for the uses made of the RBG output (by this particular TOE). This argument will include a description of the expected min-entropy rate (i.e. the minimum entropy (in bits) per bit or byte of source data) and explain that sufficient entropy is going into the TOE randomizer seeding process. This discussion will be part of a justification for why the entropy source can be relied upon to produce bits with entropy.

The amount of information necessary to justify the expected min-entropy rate depends on the type of entropy source included in the product.

For developer-provided entropy sources, in order to justify the min-entropy rate, it is expected that a large number of raw source bits will be collected, statistical tests will be performed, and the min-entropy rate determined from the statistical tests. While no particular statistical tests are required at this time, it is expected that some testing is necessary in order to determine the amount of min-entropy in each output.

For third-party provided entropy sources, in which the TOE vendor has limited access to the design and raw entropy data of the source, the documentation will indicate an estimate of the amount of min-entropy obtained from this third-party source. It is acceptable for the vendor to
“assume” an amount of min-entropy, however, this assumption must be clearly stated in the documentation provided. In particular, the min-entropy estimate must be specified and the assumption included in the ST.

Regardless of the type of entropy source, the justification will also include how the DRBG is initialized with the entropy stated in the ST, for example by verifying that the min-entropy rate is multiplied by the amount of source data used to seed the DRBG or that the rate of entropy expected based on the amount of source data is explicitly stated and compared to the statistical rate. If the amount of source data used to seed the DRBG is not clear or the calculated rate is not explicitly related to the seed, the documentation will not be considered complete.

The entropy justification shall not include any data added from any third-party application or from any state saving between restarts.

=== Operating Conditions
The entropy rate may be affected by conditions outside the control of the entropy source itself. For example, voltage, frequency, temperature, and elapsed time after power-on are just a few of the factors that may affect the operation of the entropy source. As such, documentation will also include the range of operating conditions under which the entropy source is expected to generate random data. Similarly, documentation shall describe the conditions under which the entropy source is no longer guaranteed to provide sufficient entropy. Methods used to detect failure or degradation of the source shall be included.

=== Health Testing
More specifically, all entropy source health tests and their rationale will be documented. This will include a description of the health tests, the rate and conditions under which each health test is performed (e.g., at start up, continuously, or on-demand), the expected results for each health test, TOE behaviour upon entropy source failure, and rationale indicating why each test is believed to be appropriate for detecting one or more failures in the entropy source.
